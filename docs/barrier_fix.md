Blade Barrier et al infinite damage fix
=======================================

This little mod does one thing: stop Blade Barrier from instagibbing.

Note that this ONLY occurs when Casting Fixes on the ToBEx ini is set to 0, which is necessary to run ToBEx on wine.

What happens then is that this bug causes effects applied via op232 to reapply themselves infinitely while the game is paused IF one pauses the game in the same frame that the spell would be applied in.
